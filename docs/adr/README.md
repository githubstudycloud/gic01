# ADR (Architecture Decision Records)

When we make an architectural decision that changes constraints, boundaries, or defaults, we record
it as an ADR.

Rules:
- One decision per ADR.
- Include context, options considered, and consequences.
- Keep it short; link to deeper docs if needed.

How to add:
- Copy `0000-template.md` to `NNNN-title.md` (increment NNNN).
- Commit the ADR together with the code change it explains.
