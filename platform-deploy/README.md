# platform-deploy (placeholder)

Goal: one artifact, many targets.

This folder will host:
- Dockerfile(s) / image conventions
- docker-compose templates for local verification
- Helm chart(s) for K8s
- bare-metal templates (systemd, etc.)
- one-command wrappers (PowerShell + bash) for repeatable deploy/rollback with health gates
