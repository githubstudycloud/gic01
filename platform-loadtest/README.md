# platform-loadtest (placeholder)

Goal: reproducible cluster + concurrency verification.

This folder will host:
- k6/Gatling scenarios (idempotency, retry storms, hotspots, MQ redelivery, etc.)
- data generation tools
- a local K8s lab setup (kind/k3d) to spin up N replicas and dependencies for performance testing
